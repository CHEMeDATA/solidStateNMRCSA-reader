# solidStateNMRCSA-reader

Create powder-pattern spectra from CSA diagonalized values.
This demonstrate how the NMR property object is used to produced a simulated spectrum.

1) the CSA object is generated, possibly using [user-controled sliders](html/demoSimSSnmr.html).
2) An export method of the CSA object is used to create a NMR spectrum.
3) The NMR spectrum object can be visualized or exported into Mnova json files.
